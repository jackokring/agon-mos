# Modding Agon MOS

So `linux-arm64` ... The status is not good. The code seems to be
partly buildable using `agon-ez80asm`, another project someone is
working on.

Other options are waiting for a `z88dk` target, (or `sdcc`) and
work on enough conversion and have some headers only from the
`Zilog ZDS II` download.
